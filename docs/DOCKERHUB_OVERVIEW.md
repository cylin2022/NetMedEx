# NetMedEx

NetMedEx is an AI-powered knowledge discovery platform that transforms biomedical literature into actionable insights. It leverages **Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Hybrid RAG)** to synthesize structured co-mention networks with unstructured text, providing a holistic understanding of biological relationships.

## 🌟 Core Philosophy
In NetMedEx, the **Co-Mention Network** serves as a structural "scaffolding" for discovery. The **AI-driven Semantic Layer** breathes life into these connections by extracting evidence, identifying relationship types, and answering complex natural language queries.

## 🚀 Quick Start
Launch the interactive dashboard using Docker and access it at `localhost:8050`:

```bash
docker run -p 8050:8050 --rm lsbnb/netmedex
```
